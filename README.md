Welcome to my Python learning journey! This repository contains a collection of Python projects 
focused on data handling (CSV, JSON) . Each Project is designed to solve a real-world task while Practicing core 
Python concepts.

**Projects Included**

Here is the list of Data_handling Python projects. Each project focuses on a unique use case :

`vault.txt` file. Features include Base64 encoding and password strength rating.
* **PP 8: Offline Notes Locker** - A terminal-based app that encrypts personal notes using Fernet encryption.
  Supports searching by title and secure decryption.
